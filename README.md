Gaussian Process Regression and Classification on network-like topologies


Code still in pre-alpha concept testing, based on the code from Chapter 18 of Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective (2nd Edition) by Stephen Marsland, implements the algorithms in Chapter 2 and 3 of Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning by C.E. Rasmussen.

dependencies: networkx, pandas, numpy, matplotlib


readme to be updated soon (as the rest of the code, rn it's a f-in mess)
